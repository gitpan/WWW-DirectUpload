NAME
    WWW::DirectUpload - Perl module for uploading files to directupload.com

SYNOPSIS
      use WWW::DirectUpload;
      my $du = WWW::DirectUpload->new();
      $du->files(@files);
      $du->upload();

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to upload files to directupload.com using Perl.
    Its upload() method will return you the path to the original image and
    its thumbnail.

    WWW::DirectUpload uses LWP::UserAgent as its base class. So you can use
    all methods from LWP::UserAgent on WWW::DirectUpload. This allows you to
    handle your proxies directly via LWP.

Methods
    * $du->files(files)
        Use this method to tell WWW::DirectUpload which files you want to
        upload. A typical list would look like @files = ({file=>"pic1.jpg",
        tags=>""},{file=>"pic2.png", tags=>"those are my tags"});

    * $du->upload()
        This method will upload your files. It returns a list of hashrefs of
        the given files in the order you've passed them to files(). A
        typical return value would look like
        ({thumb=>"...",image=>"..."},{thumb=>"...",image=>"..."})
